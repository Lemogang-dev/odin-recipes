    <h2>The utlimate smashed ground beef burger</h2>
   <p>They’re minced beef and salt, smashed flat over a searingly hot flat-grill until you get a crispy, craggy-edged, asymmetric, cooked-through patty that’s juicy and caramelised</p>
  
   
  
  <h3> Ingredients</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>1 soft hamburger roll, buttered and toasted</li>
    <li>oppings as desired, such as mayonnaise, mustard, shredded lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and pickles</li>
    <li>110 g freshly ground beef chuck, divided into 2 balls</li>
    <li>1 slice good melting cheese,</li>
    
   </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>Prepare burger bun by laying toppings on bottom half of bun.</li>
    <li>Preheat a large stainless steel sauté pan or skillet over high heat for 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Place balls of beef in pan and smash down with a stiff metal spatula, using a second spatula to add pressure. Smashed patties should be slightly wider than burger bun.</li>
    <li>Season generously with salt and pepper and allow to cook until patties are well browned and tops are beginning to turn pale pink/gray in spots, about 45 seconds</li>
    <li>Flip patties and immediately place a slice of cheese over 1 patty, then stack the second directly on top</li>
    <li>Immediately remove from pan and transfer to waiting burger bun. Serve</li>
   </ol>
